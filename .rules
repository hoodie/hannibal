# Hannibal-Threads

## Premise
Hannibal is an async actor framework that starts async tasks for each actor.
This crate is supposed to be a thread-based version of hannibal, using threads instead of tasks.
Hannibal-threads is based on a much older version of hannibal.

## The Goal:

* Emulate the hannibal api closely but sticking with a thread based runtime.
* provide own traits: `Actor`, `Handler`
* provide own types: `Context`, `EventLoop`, `Task`
* use `std::mpsc::channel()
* reuse the `hannibal::Message` type and the `hannibal_derive` macros

## Progress

Restore early prototype of hannibal when it was still thread based.

## Next

Analyze hannibal-threads api and adapt it to resemble a subset of hannibal's api.
